`rsynthbio` is an R package that provides a convenient interface to the [Synthesize Bio](https://www.synthesize.bio/) API, allowing users to generate realistic gene expression data based on specified biological conditions. This package enables researchers to easily access AI-generated transcriptomic data for various modalities, including bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq.

To generate datasets without code, use our [web platform](https://app.synthesize.bio/datasets/).

[See the full documentation here](https://synthesizebio.github.io/rsynthbio/).

## How to Install

You can install `rsynthbio` from CRAN:

```
install.packages("rsynthbio")
```

To install the development version from GitHub, use the `remotes` package:

```
if (!("remotes" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("synthesizebio/rsynthbio")
```

Once installed, load the package:

```
library(rsynthbio)
```

## Authentication

Before using the Synthesize Bio API, you need to set up your API token. The package provides a secure way to handle authentication:

```
# Securely prompt for and store your API token
# The token will not be visible in the console
set_synthesize_token()

# You can also store the token in your system keyring for persistence
# across R sessions (requires the 'keyring' package)
set_synthesize_token(use_keyring = TRUE)
```

Load your API token for a session:

```
# In future sessions, load the stored token
load_synthesize_token_from_keyring()

# Check if a token is already set
has_synthesize_token()
```

You can obtain an API token by registering at [Synthesize Bio](https://app.synthesize.bio).

### Security Best Practices

For security reasons, remember to clear your token when you're done:

```
# Clear token from current session
clear_synthesize_token()

# Clear token from both session and keyring
clear_synthesize_token(remove_from_keyring = TRUE)
```

Never hard-code your token in scripts that will be shared or committed to version control.

## Basic Usage

Please see the [Getting Started guide](https://synthesizebio.github.io/rsynthbio/articles/getting-started.html) for more details.

### Available Modalities

The package supports multiple data modalities. You can view all available modalities with:

```
# Check available modalities
get_valid_modalities()
# Returns: "bulk" "single-cell"
```

Currently supported modalities:

- **`bulk`**: Bulk RNA-seq data
- **`single-cell`**: Single-cell RNA-seq data

### Creating a Query

The first step in obtaining AI-generated gene expression data is to create a query. The package provides sample queries for each modality:

```
# Get a sample query for bulk RNA-seq
query <- get_valid_query(modality = "bulk")

# Get a sample query for single-cell RNA-seq
query_sc <- get_valid_query(modality = "single-cell")

# Inspect the query structure
str(query)
```

The query consists of:

1. `modality`: The type of gene expression data to generate ("bulk" or "single-cell")
2. `mode`: The prediction mode (e.g., "sample generation", "mean estimation")
3. `inputs`: A list of biological conditions to generate data for

### Making Predictions

The API uses an **asynchronous model**: the query is submitted, the system polls for completion, and results are downloaded when ready. This happens automatically:

```
# Request raw counts data
result <- predict_query(query, as_counts = TRUE)

# The function will automatically:
# 1. Submit your query to the API
# 2. Poll for completion (default: checks every 2 seconds)
# 3. Download and parse results when ready
# 4. Return formatted data frames

# Access the results
metadata <- result$metadata
expression <- result$expression
```

### Advanced Options

You can customize the polling behavior and model parameters:

```
# Adjust polling timeout (default: 15 minutes)
result <- predict_query(
  query,
  poll_timeout_seconds = 1800,  # 30 minutes
  poll_interval_seconds = 5      # Check every 5 seconds
)

# Get log-transformed CPM instead of raw counts
result_log <- predict_query(query, as_counts = FALSE)

# Use deterministic latents for reproducible results
# (removes randomness from latent sampling)
result_det <- predict_query(query, deterministic_latents = TRUE)

# Specify custom library size (total count)
# Default: 10,000,000 for bulk; 10,000 for single-cell
result_custom <- predict_query(query, total_count = 5000000)

# Control library size behavior for reference-conditioned queries
# (forces use of specified total_count even with a reference)
result_fixed <- predict_query(query, fixed_total_count = TRUE)

# Combine multiple options
result_combined <- predict_query(
  query,
  total_count = 8000000,
  deterministic_latents = TRUE,
  as_counts = TRUE
)
```

#### Parameter Details

- **`deterministic_latents`** (logical): If `TRUE`, the model uses the mean of each latent distribution instead of sampling, producing deterministic outputs for the same inputs. Useful for reproducibility.

- **`total_count`** (integer): Library size used when converting predicted log CPM back to raw counts. Higher values scale counts up proportionally. If a reference expression is supplied and `fixed_total_count` is `FALSE`, the model will use the reference's observed total counts instead.

- **`fixed_total_count`** (logical): Controls whether to preserve the reference's library size (reference-conditioned queries only). If `FALSE`, `total_count` is taken from the reference sample(s). If `TRUE`, `total_count` is taken from the request parameter even when a reference is provided.

## Rate Limits

Free usage of Synthesize Bio is limited.
If you exceed this limit, you will receive an error message stating that you've exceeded your limit.
